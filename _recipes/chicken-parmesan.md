4 lbs of chicken will yield leftovers. Otherwise 2 lbs will feed 3 people. This recipe provides enough noodles and sauce for two people to have leftovers.
- Chop the onion. Add to a stainless steel bowl and mix in the garlic.
- Trim chicken breasts and pound flat between sheets of parchment paper until about 1/4" thick.
- Mix the batter coating on a large plate:
  - 1/2 cup Flour
  - Salt
  - Pepper
- Dredge flattened chicken breasts in flour mixture. Set aside on wax paper. Save extra flour mix for additional coverage if needed.
- In the skillet, heat olive oil (1/4 cup) and butter (1 tbsp) over medium heat.
- Fry chicken breasts until golden brown on each side (~3 min/side).
- Remove chicken breasts from the skillet and keep warm (on plate with microwave cover).
- Add the chopped onion and garlic to the skillet, then stir periodically until softened.
- Start a pot of boiling salted water with oil for the pasta.
- Add to skillet, then scrape up fond using:
  - Wine (Red or white, 3/4 cup)
- Allow wine to cook down by half (~2 min).
- Add to skillet, then reduce heat when warmed:
  - Crushed tomatoes
  - Salt and pepper
- Cook the pasta.
- Carefully lay chicken breasts on top of sauce, cover in Parmesan and sprinkle on some parsley.
- Cover skillet, reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until cheese has melted and chicken is cooked through (~10 min).
- Plate cooked noodles, cover with sauce. Place chicken breast on plated noodles, sprinkle with parsley and parmesan.
