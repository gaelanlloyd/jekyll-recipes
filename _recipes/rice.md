- Bring 1.75 cups of salted water to a rolling boil.
- Add rice. Stir once, gently.
- Cover and simmer undisturbed for 18 min.
- Remove from heat, let sit undisturbed for 5 min.
- Fluff rice before serving.
- If rice is done early, open lid, place folded towel over pan, replace lid. Towel will help absorb excess moisture so rice doesn't become mushy.
