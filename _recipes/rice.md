Version 1 (Ian)

- Bring 1.5 cups water to a rolling boil.
- Add rice and salt, return water to a boil.
- Cover, remove from heat.
- Don't disturb for 10 minutes.

Version 2 (Online)

- Add salt.
- Bring 1.75 cups water to a rolling boil.
- Add rice. Stir once, gently.
- Cover and simmer undisturbed for 18 min.
- Remove from heat, let sit undisturbed for 5 min.
- Fluff rice before serving.
- If rice is done early, open lid, place folded towel over pan, replace lid. Towel will help absorb excess moisture so rice doesn't become mushy.
