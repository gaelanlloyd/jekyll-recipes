- Bring 3.5 cups of salted water to a rolling boil.
- Add rice. Stir once, gently.
- Cover and simmer undisturbed for 18 min.
- Remove from heat, let sit undisturbed for 5 min.

- If rice is done early: Open lid, place folded towel over pot, replace lid. Towel will help absorb excess moisture so rice doesn't become mushy.
