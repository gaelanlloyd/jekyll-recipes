## NEXT TIME

- Try rapid searing the chicken in the oven broiler. Cube, oil, and salt the chicken. Place on wire grill on baking sheet. Broil 7-8 min, attended closely, until one side is lightly browned.
- Otherwise, use three pans to speed up the chicken browning process.

## INSTRUCTIONS

- In the mixing bowl, combine:
  - Mushroom soup
  - Chicken soup
