- Remove the air fryer basket from the appliance and set aside.
- Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees / 12 minutes on "Air Fry" mode. Reduce time to 8 minutes if using very thin fillets. 
- Put the flour in one prison bowl; mix with about 1 tsp Montreal steak seasoning.
- Mix the bread crumbs/crushed crackers and the parmesan cheese in the second prison bowl. More Montreal, salt, and/or pepper can be added to taste, but the cheese already adds some saltiness. 
- Crack the egg into the medium bowl and whisk until the yolk is blended.
- Prepare the fish fillets:
	- Dry the fillet with a paper towel.
	- Dip each fillet in the flour; flip to coat both sides.
	- Then dip in the egg, coating each side.
	- Then roll in the breadcrumbs/crackers and parmesan until evenly coated on all surfaces. 
	- Carefully place the coated fillet in the fry basket. Arrange all pieces so that none are touching. 
- When all fish are coated, insert the fry basket into the air fryer. You may have to readjust the time--12 minutes for thick fillets, 8 minutes for very thin ones. 
- When finished, the breading should have a good amount of visible browning--not just a touch, but not turning black. Occasional high peaks of the breading may have black tips--that's OK. 
- When in doubt, check the temperature with a probe. White fish is done at 145 degrees.
