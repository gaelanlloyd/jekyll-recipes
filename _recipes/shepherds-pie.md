- Chop the onion.
- Heat the pots with oil or butter over medium-high heat.
- Add the beef evenly between the pots and mix in a total of:
  - Garlic (1 tsp)
  - Salt (2 tsp)
  - Pepper (2 tsp)
  - Chopped onion
- Cook until meat is evenly browned.
- Then, mix in to each pot:
  - Cooking wine
  - 2.5 tbsp flour
- Continue to cook for another minute.
- Transfer the beef into the larger pot.
- Then, mix in:
  - Tomato paste (4 tbsp)
  - Mushroom soup
  - Chicken broth
  - Worcestershire sauce
  - Rosemary (2 tsp)
  - Thyme (2 tsp)
- Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover.
- Simmer for 15 minutes until the sauce has thickened.
- Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
- Place baking sheets in oven to catch drips.
- While the sauce is simmering, prepare the mashed potatoes according to the package instructions.
- Mix in the frozen corn and peas (use about 1.5 lbs).
- Spray the casserole dishes with Pam.
- Spread the mixture evenly into the casserole dishes and press it down.
- Top with mashed potatoes. Using a spatula, put large clumps down. Gently smooth over the potatoes, pulling towards the edges and pressing down. Create a seal at the edges to prevent the mixture from bubbling over.
- Bake for 25 min until the potatoes begin to brown.
- Spray the potato surface with Pam to help crisping.
- Broil for a minute or two to crisp the top of the potatoes.
- Allow to cool at least 15 min before serving.
