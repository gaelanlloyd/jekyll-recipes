**Recipe modification idea:** Try frozen carrot, peas, and corn mix to save time. Add them in to the pot at the broth and spices step.

- Chop the onion.
- Dice the carrots. Cut lengthwise, then again, then dice.
- Heat the pot with oil or butter over medium-high heat.
- When the oil starts to shimmer, add the onion and carrots. Saute for 3-4 min.
- Then, add the beef and:
  - Garlic (1 tsp)
  - 2 tsp each salt and pepper
  - Cooking wine
- Cook until meat is evenly browned.
- Stir in 5 tbsp flour over the beef. Continue to cook for another minute.
- Then, add to the pot:
  - 4 tbsp Tomato paste
  - Mushroom soup
  - Chicken broth
  - Worcestershire sauce
  - 2 tsp Rosemary
  - 2 tsp Thyme
- Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover.
- Simmer for 15 minutes until the sauce has thickened.
- While the sauce is simmering, prepare the mashed potatoes according to the package instructions.
- Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
- Add to the pot:
  - Corn
  - Peas
- Spread the mixture evenly into the casserole dish.
- Top with mashed potatoes, starting around the edges.
- Use a spatula to smooth over the potatoes, creating a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling over.
- Place dish on a baking sheet to catch drips into the middle of the oven.
- Bake for 25 min until the potatoes begin to brown.
- Broil for a minute or two to crisp the top of the potatoes.
- Allow to cool at least 15 min before serving.
