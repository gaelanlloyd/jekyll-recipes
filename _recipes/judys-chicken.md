**Recipe modification idea:** Try pre-cooked chicken strips. If frozen, let thaw and cut them into smaller pieces if they're really long. Saves lots of time!

- Cut tortillas into 1 inch wide strips.
- Cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes.
- Cook the chicken 1 lb at a time in olive oil on medium heat until lightly browned.
- In the large mixing bowl, add and then mix thoroughly:
    - Mushroom soup (leave condensed)
    - Milk
    - Cheese
    - Salsa
    - Minced onion
- Spray the casserole dish with Pam.
- Layer the casserole dish two times with:
    - Diagonal lattice of tortilla strips
    - Chicken
    - Cover with sauce
- End with a final layer of:
    - Latticed tortilla strips
    - Cheese on top
- Bake at 350 degrees or until casserole is bubbling (about 45 min).
