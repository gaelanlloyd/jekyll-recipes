You'll be working with two cooking devices simultaneously: The skillet and the Instapot.

## Phase 1

- Split the meat between both devices. Brown in butter, salt, and pepper until all water evaporates and pan fond develops.

- While the meat is browning:
  - Microwave 2 cups of water until hot.
  - Mix in thoroughly:
    - 3 cups-worth of beef stock
    - 3 tbsp jar garlic
    - 3 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
  - Dice the onion.

- When the meat is done, combine in the Instapot. Add:
  - The hot water stock mix.
  - 1 extra cup of water.
- Pressure cook for 25-60 min.

## Phase 2

- Start the pasta water. Cook the pasta.
- In the pan, add and saute (retain any fond):
  - Onion
  - Mushrooms
  - 2 tbsp flour
- When pressure cooking is done, open and add the veggies.
- Deglaze pan with white wine, add pan scrapings to the Instapot.
- Start the Texas toast.
- Simmer in Instapot with lid off.
- Serve with sour cream.
